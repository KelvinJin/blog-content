When talking about God, some of us may feel disgusted. We are not, however, born being fed up with religions, just like what we treat science as. I'm lucky to have the chance discussing with two Christians in a formal way, which I believe is a better approach to understand why tons of people choose to follow Jesus, the only son of God.   There is no doubt that science is based on some basic assumptions. For instance, we having memory derives from some kind of biological mechanism and the existence of Time is still out of comprehension. Admittedly, these pre-conditions seem to be incredible, but most of us will not stand out to question them. It's not because we all believe in them, but the knowledge that limits the understanding. Similarly, the Scripture has also established such a perfect structure, in which unreasonable things are interpreted properly to convince people the world we live in can truly be understood.   After conversation with the two missionaries, I figure out there seems to be numbers of assumptions in the Christian theory. 

*   God is perfect.
*   Humans are born with sins.
*   We have to be clean or baptized before going back to God.
*   Soul is permanent, but life can just experience once.
*   We have to keep eating biscuit and drinking holy water in the church to maintain our pureness, which is called sacrifice.
*   If not accept baptism, our souls will go somewhere else.
*   There are three final places for our souls, Celestial Kingdom, Terrestrial Kingdom and Telestial Kingdom. We will be allocated to one of them based on whether or not we follow Jesus. Actually, I'm not sure how many assumptions are there in the Scripture, but as I said above, Science and Christ are indeed founded on such kind of hypothesis. The only difference between them is one for substance and another for spirit. Just as Newton, one of the greatest scientist, said: 

> He who thinks half-heartedly will not believe in God; but he who really thinks has to believe in God. Maybe it just because even if we spend our whole life trying to explain the World, there are still plenty of or more questions waiting for us to give an answer. When the moment comes, that we finally believe the World cannot be understood logically or reasonably in scientific way, we will change our mind, as Newton, to follow Jesus, getting comfort for our spirits. However, at least to me, enjoying life itself may be more attractive than trying to explain it. So keep forward, following your own heart.
